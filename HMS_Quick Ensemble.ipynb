You will develop a model trained on electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from critically ill hospital patients.\n","\n","Your work may help rapidly improve electroencephalography pattern classification accuracy, unlocking transformative benefits for neurocritical care, epilepsy, and drug development. Advancement in this area may allow doctors and brain researchers to detect seizures or other brain damage to provide faster and more accurate treatments."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Description\n","\n","From stethoscopes to tongue depressors, doctors rely on many tools to treat their patients. Physicians use electroencephalography with critically ill patients to detect seizures and other types of brain activity that can cause brain damage. You can learn about how doctors interpret these EEG signals in these videos:\n","EEG Talk - ACNS Critical Care EEG Terminology 2021 (Part 1) (Part 2) (Part 3) (Part 4) (Part 5)\n","\n","Currently, EEG monitoring relies solely on manual analysis by specialized neurologists. While invaluable, this labor-intensive process is a major bottleneck. Not only can it be time-consuming, but manual review of EEG recordings is also expensive, prone to fatigue-related errors, and suffers from reliability issues between different reviewers, even when those reviewers are experts.\n","\n","Competition host Sunstella Foundation was created in 2021 during the COVID pandemic to help minority graduate students in technology overcome challenges and celebrate their achievements. These students are vital to America's technology leadership and diversity. Through workshops, forums, and competitions, the Sunstella Foundation provides mentorship and career advice to support their success.\n","\n","Sunstella Foundation is joined by Persyst, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and the Clinical Data Animation Center (CDAC), whose research aims to help people preserve and enhance brain health.\n","\n","Your work in automating EEG analysis will help doctors and brain researchers detect seizures and other types of brain activity that can cause brain damage, so that they can give treatments more quickly and accurately. The algorithms developed in this contest may also help researchers who are working to develop drugs to treat and prevent seizures.\n","\n","There are six patterns of interest for this competition: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or “other”. Detailed explanations of these patterns are available here.\n","\n","The EEG segments used in this competition have been annotated, or classified, by a group of experts. In some cases experts completely agree about the correct label. On other cases the experts disagree. We call segments where there are high levels of agreement “idealized” patterns. Cases where ~1/2 of experts give a label as “other” and ~1/2 give one of the remaining five labels, we call “proto patterns”. Cases where experts are approximately split between 2 of the 5 named patterns, we call “edge cases”.\n","\n","Examples of EEG Patterns with Different Levels of Expert Agreement:\n","![hms1](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/Harvard%20Medical%20School/eFig2.png)\n","\n","Please refer to Data tab for full screen PDF page of each subfigure.\n","\n","This figure shows selected examples of EEG patterns with different level of agreement. Rows are structured with the 1st row seizure, 2nd row LPDs, 3rd row GPDs, 4th row LRDA, and 5th row GRDA. Column-wise, examples of idealized forms of patterns are in the 1st column (A). These are patterns with uniform expert agreement. The 2nd column (B) are proto or partially formed patterns. About half of raters labeled these as one IIIC pattern and the other half labeled “Other”. The 3rd and 4th columns (C, D) are edge cases (about half of raters labeled these one IIIC pattern and half labeled them as another IIIC pattern).\n","\n","For B-1 there is rhythmic delta activity with some admixed sharp discharges within the 10 second raw EEG, and the spectrogram shows that this segment may belong to the tail end of a seizure, thus disagreement between SZ and “Other” makes sense. B-2 shows frontal lateralized sharp transients at ~1Hz, but they have a reversed polarity, suggesting they may be coming from a non-cerebral source, thus the split between LPD and “Other” (artifact) makes sense. B-3 has diffused semi-rhythmic delta background with poorly formed low amplitude generalized periodic discharges with s shifting morphology making it a proto-GPD type pattern. B-4 shows semi-rhythmic delta activity with unstable morphology over the right hemisphere, a proto-LRDA pattern. B-5 shows a few waves of rhythmic delta activity with an unstable morphology and is poorly sustained, a proto-GRDA. C-1 shows 2Hz LPDs showing an evolution with increasing amplitude evolving underlying rhythmic activity, a pattern between LPDs and the beginning of a seizure, an edge-case. D-1 shows abundant GPDs on top of a suppressed background with frequency of 1-2Hz. The average over the 10-seconds is close to 1.5Hz, suggesting a seizure, another edge case. C-2 is split between LPDs and GPDs. The amplitude of the periodic discharges is higher over the right, but a reflection is also seen on the left. D-2 is tied between LPDs and LRDA. It shares some features of both; in the temporal derivations it looks more rhythmic whereas in the parasagittal derivations it looks periodic. C-3 is split between GPDs and LRDA. The ascending limb of the delta waves have a sharp morphology, and these periodic discharges are seen on both sides. The rhythmic delta appears to be of higher amplitude over the left, but there is some reflection of the activity on the left. D-3 is split between GPDs and GRDA. The ascending limb of the delta wave has a sharp morphology and there is asymmetry in slope between ascending and descending limbs making it an edge case. C-4 is split between LRDA and seizure. It shows 2Hz LRDA on the left, and the spectrogram shows that this segment may belong to the tail end of a seizure, an edge-case. D-4 is split between LRDA and GRDA. The rhythmic delta appears to be of higher amplitude over the left, but there is some reflection of the activity on the right. C-5 is split between GRDA and seizure. It shows potentially evolving rhythmic delta activity with poorly formed embedded epileptiform discharges, a pattern between GRDA and seizure, an edge-case. D-5 is split between GRDA and LPDs. There is generalized rhythmic delta activity, while the activity on the right is somewhat higher amplitude and contains poorly formed epileptiform discharges suggestive of LPDs, an edge-case. Note: Recording regions of the EEG electrodes are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Notes"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\"\"\"\n","Model 1 is from our good friend Chris Deotte:\n","https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/efficientnetb0-starter-lb-0-43\n","\n","Model 2 is the work of yunsuxiaozi\n","https://www.kaggle.com/code/yunsuxiaozi/hms-baseline-resnet34d-512-512-inference-6-models\n","\n","Both are fantastic notebooks that absolutely deserve credit and your \n","time! \n","\n","The strategy behind this notebook is a simple blended average of the \n","baseline resnet34d and the efficientnetB0.
